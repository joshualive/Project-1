    New York City traces its origins to a trading post founded by colonists from the Dutch Republic in 1624 on Lower Manhattan; the post was named New Amsterdam in 1626. The city and its surroundings came under English control in 1664 and were renamed New York after King Charles II of England granted the lands to his brother, the Duke of York. The city was the capital of the United States from 1785 until 1790, and has been the largest U.S. city since 1790. The Statue of Liberty greeted millions of immigrants as they came to the U.S. by ship in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and is a symbol of the U.S. and its ideals of liberty and peace. In the 21st century, New York has emerged as a global node of creativity, entrepreneurship, and environmental sustainability, and as a symbol of freedom and cultural diversity. In 2019, New York was voted the greatest city in the world per a survey of over 30,000 people from 48 cities worldwide, citing its cultural diversity.

      The Garden Island

  <p>
    Kauai is a lush paradise, with mountains, waterfalls, and a dramatic coastline. It is the oldest and westernmost of the large islands in the Hawaiian chain, and as a result has the most diverse range of plant life, a feature that has earned it the nickname of the "Garden Isle." The main attraction is the beautiful Waimea Canyon, which competes well with other scenic sites around the world. Unlike Oahu, which concentrates on cultural, urban, and entertainment-related attractions, Kauai offers a land of adventure and things to do. Some of these possibilities include boat trips to view the scenic Na Pali cliffs on the Northwest coast, kayaking down streams, helicopter flights, hiking, and the beaches.
  </p>
  <p>
    The island can be toured in two full days, with one day devoted to sites along the road west of Lihue, which curves up to Waimea Canyon, and a second day concentrating on the road that runs to the northern coast. However, most visitors will want to spend much more than two days on Kauai. Discover the best of the island with our list of the top attractions on Kauai.

    Na Pali Coast State Park encompasses a remote area of Kauai, with dramatic mountain scenery that includes cliffs, waterfalls, and lush vegetation. The Na Pali Coast in the northwest of the island is one of the most inaccessible parts of the Island of Kauai. The chain of mountains, climbing in places to 3,938 feet, forms steep cliffs plunging into the sea, whose beauty can only be fully appreciated from the water or from the air. Steep valleys on the landward side divide the mountain crests.

  Kauaʻi's climate is tropical, with generally humid and stable conditions year-round, although weather phenomena and infrequent storms have caused instances of extreme weather. At the lower elevations, the annual precipitation varies from an average of about 50 inches (130 cm) on the windward (northeastern) shore to less than 20 inches (51 cm) on the (southwestern) leeward side of the island. The average temperature in Lihu'e, the county seat, ranges from 78 °F (26 °C) in February to 85 °F (29 °C) in August and September. Kauaʻi's mountainous regions offer cooler temperatures and provide a pleasant contrast to the warm coastal areas. At the Kōkeʻe state park, 3,200–4,200 ft (980–1,280 m) ASL, day temperatures vary from an average of 45 °F (7 °C) in January to 68 °F (20 °C) in July. In the winter, temperatures have been known to drop down to the 30s and 40s at Kōkeʻe state park, which holds an unofficial record low of 29 °F (−2 °C) recorded in February 1986 at Kanaloahuluhulu Meadow.
