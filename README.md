The first project focused on front-end web development. We were required to build a site using the languages learned (HTML, CSS, JS), using one new CSS framework & two API's, one of which was new, & needed to take user input.

We built a quiz to determine where someone should go on vacation once the COVID-19 pandemic finally comes to and end. The Post-Pandemic Destination Discoverer (*satirical name intended*) is designed to take the guess work out of where you'll go on vacation so you can start dreaming of that destination now to get you through the pandemic.

We utilized the OpenWeather & Pixabay API's for this project to get local weather & photos of the destination selected after the user completes the quiz.

MVP was determined with issues opened as **REQUIREMENT** and tasks split accordingly between the 2 contributors with a focus on FE/BE for each. We successfully completed 5 additional **ENHANCEMENT** issues as well before submission. 

```
AS A human stuck in a pandemic
I WANT to know where I should go on vacation after the pandemic
SO THAT I have something to dream about
```
